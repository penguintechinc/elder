# Script to clean up corrupted Docker manifests from GitHub Container Registry
# This script removes packages with uppercase naming that conflict with lowercase versions
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated
# 2. Personal Access Token with read:packages, write:packages, delete:packages scopes
#
# Usage:
#   gh auth login --scopes "read:packages,write:packages,delete:packages"
#   ./cleanup-corrupted-manifests.sh [--dry-run]
